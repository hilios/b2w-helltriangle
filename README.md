# Hell Triangle Challenge

#### Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.

This software implements a solution strategy to the Hell Triangle game in Scala.

### Running

First you need to install the [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html) to then run:

```shell
$ sbt run
```

#### Testing

You can run the test through the [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html):

```shell
$ sbt test
# ...
[info] HellTriangleSpec:
[info] .apply
[info] - should create a proper graph like structure from a list of list
[info] #solve
[info] - should return the correct path and sum
[info] - should return the correct path and sum again
[info] Run completed in 1 second, 14 milliseconds.
[info] Total number of tests run: 3
[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
[info] Tests: succeeded 3, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 7 s, completed May 5, 2017 1:18:52 PM
```

### Instructions

Example:
```
   6
  3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4
```

In this triangle the maximum total is 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row.
So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1.

Choose the programming language you wantâ€¦ let us know about why is that your choice.

Besides the solution itself, write an automated test for your code (using a known framework
or just another function/method).

Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.

The triangle from above would be:
``` 
example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
```

We are interested in your solution considering:
1. Correctness;
2. Readability;
3. The automated test;
4. Execution time;
