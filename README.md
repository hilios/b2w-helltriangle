# Hell Triangle Challenge

#### Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.

This software implements a solution strategy to the Hell Triangle game in Scala.

**Why Scala?**

Because it is a modern, elegant and very-fast programming language based on JVM, allowing easy integration with all legacy enterprise solutions writen in Java.

Also, the language enables the use of immutable structures which makes software deterministic and functional programming style allowing to write complex operations in a linear and efficient manner.

### Running

First you need to install the [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html), then execute on your shell and follow the instructions:

```
$ sbt console
```

At the Scala REPL just import the main class and pass a list of rows of the triangle as following: 

```scala
import b2w.helltriangle.HellTriangle

val example = Seq(
    Seq(6),
    Seq(3, 5),
    Seq(9, 7, 1),
    Seq(4, 6, 8, 4)
)
// example: Seq[Seq[Int]] = List(List(6), List(3, 5), List(9, 7, 1), List(4, 6, 8, 4))

HellTriangle(example).solve
// res1: Seq[Int] = List(6, 5, 7, 8)
```

#### Iterative mode

You can interact with the program through a simple command line application:

```shell
$ sbt run
    __         ____   __       _                   __
   / /_  ___  / / /  / /______(_)___ _____  ____ _/ /__
  / __ \/ _ \/ / /  / __/ ___/ / __ `/ __ \/ __ `/ / _ \
 / / / /  __/ / /  / /_/ /  / / /_/ / / / / /_/ / /  __/
/_/ /_/\___/_/_/   \__/_/  /_/\__,_/_/ /_/\__, /_/\___/
                                         /____/

Type the numbers to each one of triangle row separated by an space and hit ENTER.
To see the solution type = (equal) and hit ENTER  or Q to exit.

Row 1 > 6
Row 2 > 3 5
Row 3 > 9 7 1
Row 4 > 4 6 8 4
Row 5 > =

   6
  3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4

Path: 6, 5, 7, 8
Sum: 26

```

#### Testing

You can run the test through the [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html):

```shell
$ sbt test
# ...
[info] HellTriangleSpec:
[info] .apply
[info] - should create a proper graph like structure from a list of list
[info] #solve
[info] - should return the correct path and sum
[info] - should return the correct path and sum again
[info] Run completed in 1 second, 14 milliseconds.
[info] Total number of tests run: 3
[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
[info] Tests: succeeded 3, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 7 s, completed May 5, 2017 1:18:52 PM
```

### Instructions

Example:
```
   6
  3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4
```

In this triangle the maximum total is 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row.
So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1.

Choose the programming language you wantâ€¦ let us know about why is that your choice.

Besides the solution itself, write an automated test for your code (using a known framework
or just another function/method).

Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.

The triangle from above would be:
``` 
example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
```

We are interested in your solution considering:
1. Correctness;
2. Readability;
3. The automated test;
4. Execution time;
